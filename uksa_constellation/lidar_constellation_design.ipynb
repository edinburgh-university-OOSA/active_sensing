    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, some of the parameters have a greater impact on the constellation size needed than others. What is missing here is an estimate of the cost of changing the parameter. For example, reducing the height to below 500 km will limit the lifetime of the mission due to atmospheric drag, requiring either more frequent replacement (buying more satellites) or else expensive [propulsion systems](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12567-022-00427-2). Other pieces have physical limits, such as the the detector and laser efficiencies which cannot be rasied above 1.\n",
